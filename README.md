# Labyrinth
A simple Web Site App that can generate labyrinth up to a 100x100 dimension and can resolve it automatically or the user can do it themself.

Others features:
- Able to download/print the labyrinth (commit 9e468a4) 
- The user can color a line of cell not just 1 by 1 (commit bdb92b6, even if sometime it don't let you drag, so it glitch the site and you need to F5, but not sure it's something I can fix)
