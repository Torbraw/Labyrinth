# Labyrinth
A simple Web Site App that can generate labyrinth up to a 100x100 dimension and can resolve it automaticly or the user can do it themself.
A futur improvement whould be to be able to download the labyrinth to a pdf or something & to allow the user to color a line of cell not just 1 by 1. We can even imagine some import/export. Who knows.
